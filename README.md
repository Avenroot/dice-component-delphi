# dice-component-delphi
This is a simple dice component that is written in Delphi.  It does include custom dice graphics.  This only supports a 6 sided dice at the moment but can be enhanced to support more (or less) sides very easily. 

I have updated this component to support Fire Monkey.  It needs more testing testing.  It also needs different packages for both VCL and FM.  If you want the VCL version just grab the orginal branch.  I branched all the Fire Monkey changes.  If you want to experiment with the FM changes just clone that branch.

Have fun!
